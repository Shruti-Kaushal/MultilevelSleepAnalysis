These measurements are organized into 7 different file or categories like sleep, activity, actigraph, saliva samples etc. In this section we will focus on transforming each of the files that we used to perform any kind of analysis. In conclusion, we worked on all the datetime columns and transformed them into the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS due to analysis convenience. We decided to not include RR.csv in our discussion, since the heartbeat information is also included in the actigraph.csv. We considered it redundant and were more interested in relating heartbeat data to activities. 3.1 Sleep The sleep file includes measurements ranging from the time the user gets into bed to the time that he gets out of bed. This file also includes measurements for total minutes spent in bed, total sleep time, number of times the user wakes up etc. Every user once in bed (to sleep) doesn’t get out of bed till morning except one. Sleep records of user 1 showed that he got out of bed at 3:31 AM and went back to sleep at 3:57 AM. For simplification of our analysis, we treated the time interval that the user was out of bed as an “awakening” i.e. when a user awaken from his sleep and remains awake for some time. This required updating the rest of the variables and depending on the definition of the variables, we either took the average or maximum or summed the two quantities corresponding to each of the “sleep sessions”. For example, “Total Sleep Time” was now the sum of the sleep time in both sessions, while “Sleep Fragmentation Index” was averaged across sessions. Sleep Measurements of User 1 We will define variables wherever needed but the reader is encouraged to go through the documentation of the dataset (link in chapter 2), to understand the variables in depth. 3.2 Actigraph Actigraph.csv contained accelerometer and inclinometer data recorded throughout the day. Overall, it tracked users’ movement data, such as steps, direction, acceleration, positions, etc. 3.2.1 Transformation process: Datetime format: We transform the time column into datetime type in R. Also, since initial time column doesn’t contain date information, we add days according to the day column to create a relative time stamp for each record in order to facilitate future calculation. Create category Position: Here we gathered columns with inclinometer information, which were Inclinometer.Off, Inclinometer.Standing, Inclinometer.Sitting, Inclinometer.Lying, transformed them into categorical column Position. By doing so, we can explore data correlations under groups of position throughout the day. 3.3 Activity 3.3.1 Definition and explanation of each column ‘Start’ and ‘end’ columns refer to the time of the day (hours:minutes) when the event happened, while ‘day’ columns refers to the day when it happened (1 and 2 refer to the first and second day of data recording, respectively). 3.3.2 Transformation process: Datetime format: Here we substitute “00:00” to “24:00” in column End to avoid calculating between wrong dates, and then transformed into the format as we did for Actigraph.csv. Relabel the activities: The document labeled the activity categories from 1 to 12. However, an extra category, labeled as 0, also included in the dataset. In this project, we will assume that the 0 represented undetermined activities. Here, we also had to deal with several minor mistakes in the dataset manually. 13 Categories of activity: undefined: all other unlabeled activity will count here. sleeping laying down sitting: e.g. studying and driving light mvmnt: e.g. slow/medium walk, chores and work. medium: e.g. fast walk and bike heavy: e.g. gym, running. eating small scr.usg: e.g. smartphone and computer. large scr.usg: e.g. TV and cinema. caff. consump.: caffeinated drink consumption, e.g. coffee or coke. smoking alc. consump.: alcohol assumption. Calculate duration for each activity: To figure the total time each user spent on each activity, we calculate time intervals (End - Start) between different activities in seconds. Plotting: We explored the dataset using geom_tile in ggplot2 package. From the plot below, we noticed that user 21 was laying down for quite a long time. 3.4 Saliva Saliva.csv collected Melatonin and Cortisol concentrations in the saliva for each participants before going to bed and after waking up. However, no data was provided for User_21 due to problem in the salivary samples that were collected. Saliva samples were collected twice - once before sleep and once after waking up. From each of the samples, the concentration of cortisol and melatonin were calculated. Melatonin levels are reported in μg per μg of protein while cortisol levels are reported in μg per 100 μg of protein. The data contains the normalized concentrations of both hormones and so no transformation or normalization is needed to use this data. 3.5 User info This file contains anthropocentric characteristics of the participant which include the gender, height in centimeters, weight in kgs and age in years. The data is pretty standard and did not require any sort of transformation "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
