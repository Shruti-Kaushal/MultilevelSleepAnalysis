There are variables that seems to have a direct relationship with sleep, for example, sleep fragmentation index and the time spent in bed, but there are others that one wouldn’t suspect being related, like height or weight of the user. Biologists may argue that they are indeed related through many different paths but as data scientists we would like to uncover those through the data. The first step is to formulate a metric for the quality of sleep using only the variables that we know are correlated to it. This would mean defining a metric over the set of variables in the sleep.csv file of every user. Preliminary analysis is done to prevent multicollinearity. Once we have established an tested our metric, we will move on to looking into how other variables affect the distribution of the metric across users. This section will be aimed at answering questions about correlation and causality. Our ultimate goal is to identify any confounders if any and quantify their relationship with the metric we define.

A myriad of variables were measured for each of the samples or “users” (what the authors of the dataset calls them) including mental state, heart rate, level of clock genes in saliva, amount of sleep to the different activities that the user does throughout the days. These measurements are organized into 7 folders i.e. for each of the 22 users we have the following 7 folders - Actigraph.csv Activity.csv questionnaire.csv RR.csv saliva.csv sleep.csv user_info.csv ## [1] &quot;user_11 is missing sleep.csv information, having errorError in `[&lt;-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, \\&quot;user\\&quot;, value = \\&quot;user_11\\&quot;): replacement has 1 row, data has 0\\n&quot; refer to the dataset documents, create some ID table. sleeping. laying down. sitting, e.g. studying, eating and driving. light movement, e.g. slow/medium walk, chores and work. medium, e.g. fast walk and bike. heavy, e.g. gym, running. eating. small screen usage, e.g. smartphone and computer. large screen usage, e.g. TV and cinema. caffeinated drink consumption, e.g. coffee or coke. smoking. alcohol assumption. 2.2 CAP We initially wanted to include this dataset in order to compare sleep quality of healthy individuals with that of diseased individuals. We anticipate not having enough time to perform this analysis now. Please stay tuned and check back after a month to see the results relating to this dataset. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Sleep 3.2 Actigraph 3.3 Activity 3.4 Questionnaire 3.5 RR 3.6 Saliva 3.7 User info", " Chapter 3 Data transformation As mentioned in the introduction, for each sample or “user” many variables were sampled over the course of two days. These measurements are organized into 7 different file or categories like sleep, activity, actigraph, saliva samples etc. In this section we will focus on transforming each of the files that we used to perform any kind of analysis. 3.1 Sleep The sleep file includes measurements ranging from the time the user gets into bed to the time that he gets out of bed. The measurements can be broadly grouped into two categories - one that actually relates to the quality of sleep, for example, sleep fragmentation index and the average awakening length, and other category includes time measurements, for example, the time it took for the user to fall asleep and the time he was in bed after waking up. Variables that fall in the second category have a lot of information but can be combined together to transform time measurements to duration. “Durations” can be easily compared across users in a succinct manner. However, there are some variables, like in-bed and out-bed time, that we used as is because transforming them would actually lead to a loss in information. We will define variables wherever needed but the reader is encouraged to go through the documentation of the dataset (link in chapter 2), to understand the variables in depth. 3.1.1 Preliminary Observations Before we delved into the data analysis part we wanted to see how each of the variables in the sleep.csv file is distributed. Upon digging into the data we realized that user 11 had no measurements for his sleep. The authors of the data did not mention a reason as to why there were no records for that particular user. Since our problem statement is about quanitfying sleep quality and the factors affecting it, we thought it only logical to remove user 11 from our analysis altogether. Formulating a metric requires an extensive analysis of the spread of the data and each variable in it. It is also important to determine correlated variables to avoid duplication and/or multicollinearity while defining the metric. Below is a heatmap we generated for variables that do not have the format of a time stamp (for example hh:mm). We made the following observations - Latent efficiency does not seem to be correlated with anything Interestingly enough, the total sleep time is not correlated with neither Number of Awakenings and Average Awakening Length. One would suspect that the form is negatively correlated to the latter two but that is not the case as these correlation coefficients are statistically significant Movement, Fragmentation and Sleep Fragmentation index are highly correlated and this relationship is statistically significant. This observation is not surprising as sleep fragmentation index is defined as the ratio of movement index and fragmentation index Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO) is strongly correlated to almost every variable with the direction being positive except for Latent Efficiency 3.2 Actigraph The only thing we need to do here is to transform the time column into datetime type in R. Also, since initial time column doesn’t contain date information, we add days according to the day column to create a relative time stamp for each record in order to facilitate future calculation. 3.2.1 Definition and explanation of each column Actigraph.csv - accelerometer and inclinometer data recorded throughout the day: Axis1: Raw Acceleration data of the X-axis expressed in Newton-meter. Axis2: Raw Acceleration data of the Y-axis expressed in Newton-meter. Axis3: Raw Acceleration data of the Z-axis expressed in Newton-meter. Steps: number of steps per second. HR: beats per minutes (bpm). Inclinometer Off: values equal to 1 refer to no activation of the inclinometer. The values are reported per second. Inclinometer Standing: values equal to 1 refer to the standing position of the user, while 0 refers to other user positions. Values are reported per second. Inclinometer Sitting: values equal to 1 refer to the sitting position of the user, while 0 refers to other user positions. Values are reported per second. Inclinometer Lying: values equal to 1 refer to the lying position of the user, while 0 refers to other user positions. Values are reported per second. Vector Magnitude: vector movement derived from raw acceleration data expressed in Newton-meter. day: 1 and 2 refer to the first and second day of data recording, respectively. time: day time when the heartbeat happened (hours:minutes:seconds) 3.3 Activity Here we substitute “00:00” to “24:00” to prevent calculating between wrong dates, and then calculate duration for each activity. The document labeled the activity categories from 1 to 12. However, an extra category, labeled as 0, also included in the dataset. In this project, we will assume that the 0 represented undetermined activities. 3.3.1 Definition and explanation of each column ‘Start’ and ‘end’ columns refer to the time of the day (hours:minutes) when the event happened, while ‘day’ columns refers to the day when it happened (1 and 2 refer to the first and second day of data recording, respectively). 3.4 Questionnaire For this part, the dataset contains the answer of a total of 7 questionnaires for each user. The questionnaires examined users’ anxiety, sleep quality, stress, emotion, etc, in order to understand the users’ behavior. No data cleaning is needed for this part. 3.4.1 Definition and explanation of each column questionnaire.csv - scores for all the questionnaires: TODO: make visualization for each scale and score of each questionnaire.csv. MEQ: Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire value. The chronotype score is ranging from 16 to 86: scores of 41 and below indicate Evening types, scores of 59 and above indicate Morning types, scores between 42-58 indicate intermediate types. STAI1: State Anxiety value obtained from State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The results are range from 20 to 80. Scores less than 31 may indicate low or no anxiety, scores between 31 and 49 an average level of anxiety or borderline levels, and scores higher than 50 a high level of anxiety or positive test results. STAI2: Trait Anxiety value obtained from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The results are range from 20 to 80. Scores less than 31 may indicate low or no anxiety, scores between 31 and 49 an average level of anxiety or borderline levels, and scores higher than 50 a high level of anxiety or positive test results. PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire Index. It gives a score rating from 0 to 21, with values lower than 6 indicating good sleep quality. BIS/BAS: Behavioural avoidance/inhibition index. BIS/BAS scales are a typical measure of reinforcement sensitivity theory that establish biological roots in personality characteristics, derived from neuropsychological differences. The BIS/BAS scales comprise a self‐report measure of avoidance and approach tendencies that contains four sub-factors (A high score in one of the subscale describes the degree of that temperamental characteristic for the individual, according to the original sample): Bis facet: reflects subject sensitivity toward aversive events that promote avoidance behaviours. Drive: describes individual persistence and motivational intensity. Reward: corresponds to Reward Responsiveness that indicates a propensity to show a higher degree of positive emotion for goal attainment. Fun: corresponds to Fun-Seeking that is related to impulsivity and immediate reward due to sensory stimuli or risky situations. Daily_stress: Daily Stress Inventory value (DSI) is a 58 items self-reported measures which allows a person to indicate the events they experienced in the last 24 hours. After indicating which event occurred, they indicate the stressfulness of the invent on a Likert scale from 1 (occurred but was not stressful) to 7 (Cause me to panic). It gives a score between 0 and 406. The higher is this values, the higher is the frequency and degree of the events and the perceived daily stress. PANAS: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. It gives a score rating between 5 and 50 for both positive and negative emotions. The higher is the PANAS value, the higher is the perceived emotion. Columns name with 10, 14, 22 and 9+1 refer to the time of the day when the questionnaire is filled in. 9+1 indicates the 9 AM of the second recording day. 3.5 RR RR dataset contains the heartbeat records for each user. We can transform ibi_s to rate of heartbeat and align with activity records using time column. Similar to Actigraph dataset, the only thing we need to do here is to transform the time column into datetime type in R. Also, since initial time column doesn’t contain date information, we add days according to the day column to create a relative time stamp for each record in order to facilitate future calculation. 3.5.1 Definition and explanation of each column RR.csv - beat-to-beat interval data: ibi_s: time in seconds between two consecutive beats. day: 1 and 2 refer to the first and second day of data recording, respectively. time: day time when the heartbeat happened (hours:minutes:seconds) 3.6 Saliva Nothing need to be transformed or cleaned in this dataset. 3.6.1 Definition and explanation of each column saliva.csv - clock genes and hormones concentrations in the saliva before going to bed and after waking up. Sample: Two samples per participant are included, one before sleep and one after waking up. Melatonin levels are reported in μg of melatonin per μg of protein. Cortisol levels are in μg of cortisol per 100 μg of protein. No clock genes and hormones concentrations data was provided for User_21 due to problem in the salivary samples that do not permit to analyse it. 3.7 User info missing age for user_18. Otherwise, nothing need to be transformed or cleaned in this dataset 3.7.1 Definition and explanation of each column user_info.csv - anthropocentric characteristics of the participant: gender: M and F refer to Male and Female, respectively. height is expressed in centimetre (cm). weight is expressed in kilograms (kg). age is expressed in years. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing Value Plot", " Chapter 4 Missing values file information missing: user_11 is missing sleep.csv information No clock genes and hormones concentrations data was provided for User_21 due to problem in the salivary samples that do not permit to analyse it. missing age for user_18 in user_info user_13 is missing questionnaire 4.1 Missing Value Plot Here we revise the function we created in problem set 4 to plot the missing patterns. Very less missing value is in the dataset. As shown in the plots, only one row with missing values exist in activity and questionnaire, respectively.
