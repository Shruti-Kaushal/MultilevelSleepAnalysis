Multilevel Sleep Analysis of Healthy Individuals vs Individuals with Chronic Sleep Disorders

Many pyschologists have time and again stressed on the importance of sound sleep and claimed that regular exercise and proper diet help boost the quality of sleep. Sleep plays an important role in a person's mental health and currently an over the counter medicine - melatonin is being used extensively worldwide as a substitute to other controversial sleep aids. What most people aren't aware of is that melatonin is a hormone that regulates our circadian rhythm, so it isn't surprising that it works. But can we provide evidence of the same using real world datasets? 

In this project, we will work with two sleep datasets that have different sample populations - 22 healthy individuals and 92 individuals with chronic sleep disorder like insomnia, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy etc. We will use multilevel sleep analysis data that documents a subject's daily activity, melatonin and cortisol levels and heart rate to look for patterns of change in sleep hormone levels and their correlation with other non-biomarker variables. This will help us characterize sleep in healthy individuals which we then hope to contrast with the characterizations made using the CAP (cyclic alternating pattern) datasets that documents ECG activity during sleep. We realize that the two datasets have completely different modality but it will be interesting to compare heart rate from healthy individuals and ECG activity of individuals with chronic sleep disorders. The link to the datasets can be found below.
