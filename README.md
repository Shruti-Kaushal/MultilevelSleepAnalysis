Multilevel Sleep Analysis of Healthy Individuals vs Individuals with Chronic Sleep Disorders

Many pyschologists have time and again stressed on the importance of sound sleep and claimed that regular exercise and proper diet help boost the quality of sleep. Sleep plays an important role in a person's mental health and currently an over the counter medicine - melatonin is being used extensively worldwide as a substitute to other controversial sleep aids. What most people aren't aware of is that melatonin is a hormone that regulates our circadian rhythm, so it isn't surprising that it works. But can we provide evidence of the same using real world datasets? 

In this project, we analyzed a comprehensive sleep dataset (MMASH) that has a sample popuplation of 22 healthy young male adults. It contains measurements for several variables such as total time spent in bed, amount of time awake, demographic variables, heart rate etc. We formulated a metric for sleep quality using a subset of these variables and analyzed the relationship of our metric with other variables including biomarkers such as cortisol and melatonin levels.

We plan to extend our study to identify patterns of change in activity levels and heart rate with sleep quality. One of the biggest challenges we faced was the small and almost homologous sample popupulation and to address this issue we would like to incorportate CAP dataset. CAP dataset contains measurements of different sleep metrics like body position, sleep duration etc for individuals with chronic sleep disorders such as REM, Bruxia, insomnia to name a few. 

Through this project tried to answer a bigger question - Can the sleep quality of individuals be improved by changing or fine-tuning certain variables/factors known to regulate the sleep quality?
