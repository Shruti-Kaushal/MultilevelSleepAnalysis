Multilevel Sleep Analysis of Healthy Individuals vs Individuals with Chronic Sleep Disorders

Many pyschologists have time and again stressed on the importance of sound sleep and claimed that regular exercise and proper diet help boost the quality of sleep. Sleep plays an important role in a person's mental health and currently an over the counter medicine - melatonin is being used extensively worldwide as a substitute to other controversial sleep aids. What most people aren't aware of is that melatonin is a hormone that regulates our circadian rhythm, so it isn't surprising that it works. But can we provide evidence of the same using real world datasets? 

In this project, we will work with two different datasets to characterize the "soundness" of sleep and analyze what factors affect its quality. Both datasets are multilevel sleep datasets that have different sample populations - healthy individuals and individuals with chronic sleep disorder.
