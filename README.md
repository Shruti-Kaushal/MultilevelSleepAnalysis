Multilevel Sleep Analysis of Healthy Individuals vs Individuals with Chronic Sleep Disorders

Many pyschologists have time and again stressed on the importance of sound sleep and claimed that daily exercise helps boost the quality of sleep. Sleep is an important part of a person's mental health and currently an over the counter medicine - melatonin is being used extensively worldwide. What most people aren't aware of is that melatonin is a hormone that regulates our circadian rhythm, so it isn't surprising that it works. 

In this project, we will look at two different datasets to make some conclusions about what kind of sleep is considered "sound" and what factors affect the quality of sleep. Both datasets are multilevel sleep datasets for two different popuplations - healthy individuals and individuals with chronic sleep disorder
