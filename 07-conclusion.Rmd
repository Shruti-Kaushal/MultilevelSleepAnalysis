# Conclusion

## Discussion

(1) Expand on imputing missing values for sleep csv of user 11
(2) Another area of discussion, which is beyond the scope of this project is to learn a DAG using all the variables and perform causal inference to identify confounders. The sleep metric can then be defined using the minimum control set or the sufficient set for the variables in the sleep.cs file. This definition will implicitly apply at least some of the relationships we identified in our results section
(3) Is it possible to use other kinds of plots to establish dependencies and correlations?
